# Importing Data
We will be using a sample DMEF dataset.

```{r}
# Navigating to your working directory (GUI)
setwd("C:/Users/Ken/Dropbox/Academics/2015/1BT1101/BIZ Analytics/Group Project/data")

# Loading the file

``

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
